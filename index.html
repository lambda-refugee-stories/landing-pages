          There are more people displaced in the world today than at any time
          since the end of World War II and it is more important than ever to
          help people develop empathy for each other. Refugee Stories promotes
          awareness of the refugee crisis, and creates a platform for refugees
          to share their experiences through story submissions. People visiting
          the site will gain a better understanding of the refugee crisis and
          what it means to be a refugee.

        According to the United Nations Refugee Agency, refugees are people
        who have fled war, violence, conflict or persecution and have crossed
        an international border to find safety in another country.

        <p>
          We often hear about the political motives of war through televised
          events, social media hashtags, and other modes of media. However,
          seldom do people around the world get to learn about the
          psychological, social, and personal impacts that these events have
          on the people who are most directly affected and likely forgotten.
          It is important for stories of refugees to be shared in order for
          the world to become more aware of the perils these victims and
          survivors of political turmoil face. Hopefully, with more empathy
          can come better decision-making and avenues for peace.

            “Being scared was a permanent state of mind. I was always scared.”
          </h4>
          <p class="full-story">For two long years Yaser's* five children, Ali*, 15, Achmed*, 14, Hala*, 10, Sedra*, 7
            and Aya*, 3, have not been able to go to school or play outside. Violence kept them from living a normal
            life. There was constant fear of sniper and missile attacks. They learned what type of weapon was being used
            just by the sound it made.

            "Being scared was a permanent state of mind. I was always scared," said Achmed. "When I went to bed, I
            always wondered if I would wake up the next morning."

            Eventually the violence became too much for Yaser and his wife, and they made the decision to uproot their
            family from their home in Syria in search of a better life in Germany. They were only able to make their
            long and difficult journey from sunset to sunrise so they would not be spotted. Young Hala lost her glasses
            during their trek.

            "Everything is already strange, but now it is also blurry," she said. "It is very scary not to be able to
            see clearly."

            They walked for days until they reached the boat that would carry them to Germany. The water was rough and
            the children were scared, but the family eventually made it. Now they must wait to register for asylum, a
            process that takes up to two weeks. During those two weeks the family must wait outside the registration
            center every day for their number to be called. There are no facilities or shelter from the rain.

            "I am tired of waiting here all day. We just stand in the rain," said Achmed. "But I will tell you
            something: after everything we have been through, a bit of rain can’t hurt me anymore."

          <h4 class="headline">
            “We left Syria one week ago. There were so many explosions...so we had to leave Syria.”
          </h4>
          <p class="full-story">Sana is three years old and fled Syria with her mother and three sisters. An
            increasingly brutal civil war is tearing Syria apart. One million people have now fled Syria and are
            sheltering in neighboring countries. Sana's 12 year old sister Yasmine describes the reason the family left:

            "We left Syria one week ago. There were so many explosions...so we had to leave Syria. What do I remember of
            Syria? I remember two things — our house being bombed, and not having any bread. Most of the houses were
            being hit. We had to stay in one room, all of us. The other rooms were being hit — shooting from the side of
            the other rooms. The bombs were hitting constantly, I was very scared."

            Sana* and her sisters were forced to live in one room for two weeks as their home was destroyed around them.
            Yasmine* talks of her fear:

            "I felt so afraid, I knew we could not move from that one room. There were 13 of us in total, crammed into
            one room. We did not leave that room for two weeks. It was always so loud."

            All of the sisters were gathered at home one day, and saw their father killed outside their home. Yasmine
            describes that day:

            "My father left the room. I watched my father leave, and watched as my father was shot outside our home. I
            started to cry, I was so sad. We were living a normal life. We had enough food, now we depend on others.
            Everything changed for me that day."

            The family now live close to the Syria border in a neighboring country, in an informal settlement. Their
            tent is small, dank and dark, and none of the children are going to school. Their mother leaves them each
            day to try and find work in nearby towns, and to try and find food. Sana is deeply affected by what she
            witnessed and endured in Syria.

          <h4 class="headline">
            “I want to believe we can have a secure and peaceful life again.”
          </h4>
          <p class="full-story">Farah* and Adnan* led a comfortable, successful life in Syria. They had a large house
            overlooking the city where they lived with their two children, Fathi*, 3, and Zeinah*, 1. Farah was hoping
            to return to school to continue her education, which she put on hold after having her first child, and
            Adnan, an Arabic teacher, was pursuing a law degree. Their large, tight-knit family – Adnan has 8 sisters
            and 5 brothers and Farah has a large family as well – all lived nearby.

            Then their house was seized by fighters because of its location. Soon after that is was destroyed. They were
            homeless and nearby cities were under attack. Before the bombings could start in their city, Farah and Adnan
            made the choice to leave their home in order to keep their children safe.

            "My children were born in the city and my whole family lived there, but we had to flee to Turkey during one
            of the outbreaks of fighting," said Farah. "If we hadn’t left when we did we would have been killed along
            with so many other people. We left Syria at the right time."

            Farah, Adnan and their children stayed in Turkey for one year before making the short but treacherous
            journey to Kos, Greece. Farah thought they would die on the boat there, and when they arrived they were
            often not treated well in their hotels and had to keep moving around. Farah estimates they spent almost
            $1,400 on hotel rooms their first week in Kos.

            Spending money on hotels is not their only worry though. Both of their children desperately need to see a
            doctor.

            "No one knows what is wrong with my son," Farah said. "His eyes are always inflamed, he has a sore throat
            and every night his nose bleeds. My baby [Zeinah] also needs a doctor as she is bow legged and needs her
            legs corrected."

            Save the Children is giving Fathi and Zeinah the emotional and psychical support they need, but their
            journey is far from over. Farah and Adnan are soon leaving Greece to make their way to Germany, a nearly
            2,000 mile trek. Farah is just ready to find a place to call home.

            "I want to believe we can have a secure and peaceful life again."
